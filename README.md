# Troll-Detection-using-BERT

This repository contains the code and resources for Troll Detection using BERT, a machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying troll comments using the BERT model.

Troll Detection using BERT is a project that focuses on leveraging the power of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for identifying troll comments in social media platforms. The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify comments as troll or non-troll based on their content.
